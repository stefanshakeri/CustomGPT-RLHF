# CustomGPT-RLHF
RLHF for a CustomGPT from OpenAI's CustomGPTs. 

## Purpose
Since Custom GPTs cannot be fine-tuned or called through an API, this RLHF system can't fine-tune the model. The 'Reinforcement Learning' part of RLHF would have to be done through manual changes to the Custom GPT prompt. However, this system is useful in evaluating if the Custom GPT is heading in the right direction, and can then be augmented manually.
